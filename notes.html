  <h1> Subtle Additions </h1>
  <p>
   We added a gradient background that fits the theme. We preserved the screen aspect ratio for the iframe. We increased the size of the person_image while perserving the aspect ratio. We added coin images for unordered list items.
   We used a custom font on the home page and nav bar and used an additonal font for all of the text besides the home page. We made sure the page worked as intened when partner logged in.
   We made sure Mario wouldn't cover anything up on the pages. We filled the background of the seating chart with a different color. We changed the hyper link color to match our mario image exactly and provide high contrast with the background.
