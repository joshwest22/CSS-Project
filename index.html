<h1>Distribution of Pakistani Languages</h1>
<p>
Pakistan is very diverse in terms of its ethnolinguistic distributions. In many areas, people of different races and languages live
together and speak a national common tongue with one another to communicate. This national language is called Urdu. In addition to Urdu, English is also stated to be an official language of the country.
However, most of these people prefer to call their ethnic
languages as their first.
In many other areas, though, people of similar ethnolinguistic backgrounds live together.
Since the number of individual languages spoken in pakistan is 74, we will just focus on the six main languages which constitute about 95%
of the entire population.
</p>
<p>As touched on above, many languages correspond to a particular ethnic group. Thus, in an effort to provide a more complete background of the current linguistic climate of Pakistan, here is a list of the most prevalent ethnic groups by percentage of the national population as provided by worldatlas.com:</p>
<ol>
<li>Punjabi (44.7%)</li>
<li>Pashtun (15.4%)</li>
<li>Sindhi (14.1%)</li>
<li>Sariaki (8.4%)</li>
<li>Muhajir (7.6%)</li>
<li>Balochi (3.6%)</li>
<li>Other (6.2%)</li>
</ol>
<p>
The following table shows the language spoken and some ethnolinguistic details about the
population that speak that language as their first. The percentages are collected from official estimates by the Pakistani government.

The above table summarizes the diversity of languages and people of pakistan. Keep in mind that the table shows the percentage of people
speaking each of those languages as their first language, so it does
not include people who know different languages. So, the raw percentage of people who know, for example, urdu, would be much higher. In addition, a map of Pakistan breaking it down into its provinces has been provided to provide geographical context.</p>
<p>Notice the almost perfect correspondence between the most prevalent ethnic groups and the most commonly spoken languages. This underlies the importance of understanding the fact that many of the most commonly spoken languages in Pakistan are inseperable from their represented ethnic groups. The four provincial languages (Punjabi, Pashto, Sindhi, and Balochi), which are the most commonly spoken languages in the four major regions of the country, also feature prominently on this list.</p>
<p>In addition to the major languages, there are at least three important minority languages. These include English (the official language during the colonial era as well as an official language of Pakistan along with Urdu), Arabic (the language of Islam, the majority religious tradition), and Persian.</p>
